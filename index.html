                        <p>I've loved traveling since I was a kid. I was shorter than our livingroom coffee table and my mom had me packed up to go see grandad, singing Jagged Edge in the backseat. I remember interminable boredom and not knowing what was happening for days at a time. Outside of those constant foggy naps and the occasional rest stop and photo op I traveled the East coast with my mom to see family or just a field trip.</p>
                        <p>These days my travels require me to be a bit more conscious. This next drive is going to be doozey but I can't wait to get on the road and be done with the dozens of hours.</p>
                        <p>Much like the dozens of hours I'm going to spend driving I also intend on putting in work toward fcc and odin project while I'm "on vacation."</p>

                        <p>For the past few years I've been watching a gentleman on youtube named jon jondai. He is an authority on earthen building and being a general good steward of the earth. He emphasizes using natural materials found around you, preferring native varieties to production or import materials. A major goal of mine is to create food security for my family and our neighbors by nurturing native plants like edibles, ornimental plants, and with a bit of patience - hardwoods! </p>
                        <p>I mention all that to say - I want to plant some seeds with my coding. This blog page for one will be a great springboard for my ideas to live, a place for my self reporting and reflection of my coding practice to happen.</p>
                        <p><em>Speaking of coding practice</em> - I will be spending the next day or two working through freeCodeCamps next offering: Intermediate CSS and a capstone project of Technical Page! I will link to all the pages as I get them wireframed and hosted on github.</p>

                        <p>"u win u lose"</p>
                        <p></p> 
                        <p>Missed a post yesterday because I was working on Odin Project submission formatting and honestly havent established any regularity yet. Let this be a genuine attempt at routine for my new coding practice and for product upkeep. </p>
                        <p>When I was rock climbing more frequently I took yoga classes. In the classes the instructor used to emphasize building a practice that caters to your lifes needs, stressing that all of our bodies have immense networks of interconnectedness.</p> 
                        <p>One such vast network I have been learning about recently is the <em>Autonomic Nervous System</em> "a component of the peripheral nervous system that regulates involuntary physiologic processes including heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and sexual arousal."</p> 
                        <p>Building a routine around coding and creating - a practice as my former instructor would say - is much like building routines around your ANS that can help improve depression, and more importantly for me, general physiological response to daily life. Defusing myself in so many different ways after service and finding ways to improve my health has been a journey in practice, one that now includes blog posts for the forseeable future. ðŸ¤£</p>

                        <p>After a lot of work I have a functioning blog hosted here on github. I can market it and I can use it to point to my various creative projects. I love this git setup because its like a really light website with great ability for customization. Let this be proof that you can go from very little knowledge of web dev to something in a short time.</p>

                        <p>thankful for some clarity - finally! starting next week my goal is to bring high-quality blog posts surrounding my video subjects on tik tok and youtube. im wire-framing some ideas for blogs and vids and I believe that with some effort I can show low-to-no-budget nights and weekend producers, engineers, artists -- CREATIVES how to put their passion on the web at a low cost with the ability to keep assets and transfer to a domain admin come the time to sign or whatever they're trying to do!</p>
