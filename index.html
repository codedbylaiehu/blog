The lessons are organized in a table of contents, which can be opened directly in the program via the Help menu. We highly recommend following the lessons. Many users have told us that the lessons helped them become familiar with the program very quickly.</p>
                                    <p>We also recommend that you read the Live Concepts chapter (<a href="/en/manual/live-concepts/">see Chapter 4</a>), which encapsulates everything that Live is and can do, and is therefore a worthwhile read for both beginners and experienced users. The remaining chapters of this manual serve as in-depth reference for the material introduced in Live Concepts.</p>

                        <p>"im on vacation!"</p>
                        <p></p> 
                        <p>I have been on wor-cation for a couple of weeks, staying with my sister. I've been applying to jobs, some developer, but most are in the current professional lane.</p>
                        <p>A large reason for me wanting to switch over to development is because my current profession, public health communications, is pretty limited without a degree and without a deep network to help sustain work - especially in the NPO sector.</p>
                        <p>I am still making progress on freeCodeCamps and I have stalled on the Odin progress to make sure I can work more consistently across all my jobs.</p>
                        <p>Finishing the product page project was difficult. I kept running into issues with resizing the viewport over third section. Elements were just not stacking on top of each other when in mobile sizes. I remedied this set of issues by retooling the media queries to include a large minimum screen size for desktop viewing, range for ipad/tablet viewing, and max for iphone/phone viewing. After dividing the overall range I made the desktop grid layout collapse down to block display on mobile. Everything looked pretty good! Though I neglected the styling on the email portion of the page to get the code turned in. I feel like I can have more opportunities to style inputs and email submit buttons in the future for freeCodeCamp so a couple demerits wont hurt too much.</p>

                        <p>I start another long drive tomorrow and I'm looking forward to a change of scenery and general change of pace. Traveling has also been one of my favorite things to do ever since I was young, though it's gotten harder as I've aged.</p>
                        <p>I'm finding more points of resistance in my coding journey, not understanding fully how to articulate a creative expression in html/css with a good degree of fedelity. For instance, I want my product page #section2 to shrink down to<code>1col 1fr</code>  during a media query but for some reason it wont unstack into <code>3cols 1fr 60% 1fr</code>.</p>
                        <p>I remember, from my IT career, the amount of roadblocks and resistance I would run into while learning the technical side of the job. Being overwhelmed by reading partial technical documentation and being expected to get the job done. A lot of learing coding has been a similar experience in resourcefulness and what I am only now beginning to realize is balance. Balance in effort, balance in health, plently of different intersectional balancing acts within and without.</p>
                        <p>Today I challenge myself to self-start, get coding and blog post completed, but also to address life and the prep before the trip. Off to build a product page in pure HTML/CSS. ..laiehu</p>

                        <p></p> 
                        <p>Today is a new day and just as I said in my last blog post, reaching your limit to most anything can be emotional. Last night the emotion was one of exhaustion and frustration. I'm trying to stay brave and hopeful in a job market that regularly disregards veterans and people of color, algorithms that ignore human need amongst an even more stratified population.</p>
                        <p>Looking at junior web dev jobs remotely and in my area I don't find a host of positions I can apply to, some of the ones I have found are international and pay only $400/mo. My optimism fades when I look at the job market, less so than it did before learning how to code but I am shocked to see that it's not much different than my harrowing job search two years ago during the height of the pandemic.</p>
                        <p>One thing I want to make sure I do in every expression is remain human, mortal, empathetic - I believe a trend is happening that incentivizes people and organizations to behave inhumanely on digital platforms and that behavior is spreading into the physical world. I alos believe that the only way to address an issue like that is to create a digital culture that expresses humanity and empathy.</p>
                        <p>I am far from giving up on any coding efforts I've been making, but I do want to include moments like this - moments of doubt and darkness - as readily as I would moments of clarity and excitement, at least for my personal brand of online culture, because I am a mortal human with emotions and experiences.</p>
                        <p>Soon this blog will look much different, more sleek and with nicely animated blog post cards. It wont have my plaintext opinions or any personal feeling pieces sans the rare exception here or there. In the meantime I'm honored to show other learners or potential employers a glimpse of the non-digital me. ..laiehu</p>

                    <div class="story">
                        <p>"lots of goals, little time"</p>
                        <p></p> 
                        <p>I have around 26 major benchmarks that I need to meet within a very short period of time. That makes at least one benchmark every working day for the next month-and-some-change.</p>
                        <p>I come from a hands-on working background so adjusting to work-from-home has been a balancing act with productivity and burnout on one end of the scale and relaxing oblivion on the other.</p>
                        <p>Dedication to learning web design enough to produce regular blog content places weight on that balanced scale, weight that I need to make adjustments for.</p>
                        <p>I have a few practices that help in adjusting my work-life balance when I feel it's out of balance. The first practice is practice itself, how you approach practice effects outcomes of training and performance in a macro way. Building a good understanding of how you and others approach different habits, routines and practices is key for developing any skill.</p>
                        <p>The second practice is empathy. I need a break sometimes and being able to fully step away from things without guilt or anxiety is a crucial part of that work-life scale being balanced. I try to make empathy the cornerstone of behavior in my personal life and at work, which helps keep that scale balanced nicely.</p>
                        <p>The third and final practice is grit. I have learned through my military experience and general working life that all careers, jobs, and tasks have a spectrum of positive and negative moments available to be experienced while performing them. Grit is my ability to maintain the necessary state of being to perform well through the negative moments of the task, job, or career. I feel that I exercise grit when my "relaxing practice" takes over too much and I've procrastinated for too long or forgot a key detail and so must work through the mess it include it, being almost forced to put things into motion and provide an outcome. Reaching that threshold of too much work often happens to me when I become complacent about a task or responsibility, or when the work required of me is seemingly too much to handle. </p>
                        <p>Every time I approach that threshold does not result in exercising and raising the threshold, it's often scary and sometimes requires me to face-up to things I'm not prepared for, things like addressing my organization style or mental health. The biggest reason I even advocate for a set of practices or routines around work is because, whether we want to or not, as people we face that limit of work or willpower and it can be frightening, daunting - sometimes finding ourselves unable to push through the threshold. Not being able to break through the barriers we might fall back to our previous states, or worse for some who lack support or information. Having a solid foundation of practices is a support structure to stand on, a set of tools to adjust your balance. ..laiehu</p>

                        <p>I finally finished the <a href="https://codedbylaiehu.github.io/laiehuLearning/freeCodeCampTechDoc/">technical document project</a> I started on Friday that featured a lovely technical document - challenging! I struggled with the over-sensative nature of the stick css property but overcame it with grace and beauty by frankensteining a lovely solution out of background colors!</p>
                        <p>My initial issue was that the menu would not stay in place and I was forced to shuffle around a bunch of the DOM and then restructure some of the css. After that sprint I had to make the text flow over the nav menu in the mobile version.</p>  
                        <p>Though I would say that the page is not production ready, I also love that the solution to the menu never moving with the media query was a simple and literal gloss over the menu. I add body-matching background color to the body text so that it is still legible over the menu and you can still make menu selections through the dense column of reference text.</p>
                        <p>I'm looking forward to the day where I don't manually type every line of code out and can instead trust the sources of information or templating.</p>

                        <p>I've loved traveling since I was a kid. I was shorter than our livingroom coffee table and my mom had me packed up to go see grandad, singing Jagged Edge in the backseat. I remember interminable boredom and not knowing what was happening for days at a time. Outside of those constant foggy naps and the occasional rest stop and photo op I traveled the East coast with my mom to see family or just a field trip.</p>
                        <p>These days my travels require me to be a bit more conscious. This next drive is going to be doozey but I can't wait to get on the road and be done with the dozens of hours.</p>
                        <p>Much like the dozens of hours I'm going to spend driving I also intend on putting in work toward fcc and odin project while I'm "on vacation."</p>

                        <p>For the past few years I've been watching a gentleman on youtube named jon jondai. He is an authority on earthen building and being a general good steward of the earth. He emphasizes using natural materials found around you, preferring native varieties to production or import materials. A major goal of mine is to create food security for my family and our neighbors by nurturing native plants like edibles, ornimental plants, and with a bit of patience - hardwoods! </p>
                        <p>I mention all that to say - I want to plant some seeds with my coding. This blog page for one will be a great springboard for my ideas to live, a place for my self reporting and reflection of my coding practice to happen.</p>
                        <p><em>Speaking of coding practice</em> - I will be spending the next day or two working through freeCodeCamps next offering: Intermediate CSS and a capstone project of Technical Page! I will link to all the pages as I get them wireframed and hosted on github.</p>

                        <p>Missed a post yesterday because I was working on Odin Project submission formatting and honestly havent established any regularity yet. Let this be a genuine attempt at routine for my new coding practice and for product upkeep. </p>
                        <p>When I was rock climbing more frequently I took yoga classes. In the classes the instructor used to emphasize building a practice that caters to your lifes needs, stressing that all of our bodies have immense networks of interconnectedness.</p> 
                        <p>One such vast network I have been learning about recently is the <em>Autonomic Nervous System</em> "a component of the peripheral nervous system that regulates involuntary physiologic processes including heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and sexual arousal."</p> 
                        <p>Building a routine around coding and creating - a practice as my former instructor would say - is much like building routines around your ANS that can help improve depression, and more importantly for me, general physiological response to daily life. Defusing myself in so many different ways after service and finding ways to improve my health has been a journey in practice, one that now includes blog posts for the forseeable future. 🤣</p>

                        <p>After a lot of work I have a functioning blog hosted here on github. I can market it and I can use it to point to my various creative projects. I love this git setup because its like a really light website with great ability for customization. Let this be proof that you can go from very little knowledge of web dev to something in a short time.</p>

                        <p>thankful for some clarity - finally! starting next week my goal is to bring high-quality blog posts surrounding my video subjects on tik tok and youtube. im wire-framing some ideas for blogs and vids and I believe that with some effort I can show low-to-no-budget nights and weekend producers, engineers, artists -- CREATIVES how to put their passion on the web at a low cost with the ability to keep assets and transfer to a domain admin come the time to sign or whatever they're trying to do!</p>
